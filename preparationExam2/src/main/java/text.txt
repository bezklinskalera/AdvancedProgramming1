Text with banished words (credit to Bing Chat):
The gaslighting of the public by politicians is absolutely unprecedented.
They pivot from one issue to another, irregardless of the consequences.
It's amazing how they can manipulate the truth to suit their own agenda.
But the people are not fooled by their tactics anymore.
They are starting to see through the lies and deception.
The bromance between politicians and big corporations is also becoming more apparent.
They tote the same line and work together to maintain their power and influence.
But the people are starting to demand change.
They want a government that works for them, not just for the rich and powerful.
